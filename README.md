# Rabbit Cipher Implementation

This is an implementation of the [Rabbit Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_(cipher)) stream cipher encryption algorithm. Rabbit is part of the [eSTREAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESTREAM). The original paper can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-39887-5_23.pdf).

This implementation is very crude and not optimal. It is an implementation that takes in a 128bit key and 64bit initialization vector.
